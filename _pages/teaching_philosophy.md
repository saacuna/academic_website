## Teaching Philosophy

When students enter my classroom, there is music playing. It may sound trivial, but it creates a much more relaxed environment than a traditional engineering classroom. It is also a way to engage my students—during the previous lesson I recruit a student to provide a playlist of music for the 10 minutes before the class starts. I have found this simple activity teaches us more about each other and makes me more accessible as an instructor. I also want my students to live a wholesome and balanced life and not spend their life solely in pursuit of academic success, so I need to set an example of that as well. I am still looking for a way to incorporate my electric guitar into the classroom. Either way, I always bring an exciting personality into the classroom.

I plan my lessons using a backwards design framework. In this way, I am aware of the learning objectives and how I will assess the students well before I plan the actual instructional activity. The learning objectives frame my lessons, and I write them to cover higher levels of Bloom’s taxonomy. As much as possible, I try to plan active learning activities because there is a ton of research demonstrating that students learn better this way. A typical lesson would start off with a quick follow-up from the past lesson, such as reviewing a tough homework problem or a muddy point that students did not understand. Then before diving into the lesson, I write out the main take-away for the day so there is no surprise to the students about what to expect. Sometimes I do leave a “fill in the blank” here, so it gives them a little challenge of what to look for throughout the lesson.

I try to start each lesson with some introductory question to get the students thinking. This engages their prior knowledge to prepare for instruction, but also lets them interact a bit with each other to share ideas. It also gives me some feedback on the level the students are performing at, so I can tailor my instruction for the day. Groups of students try to tackle the introductory question, and then we field a small discussion before I provide the answer. I try to limit my lecturing to no more than 15 minutes before another small activity, usually in the groups. 

At the end of the lesson I conduct some quick formative assessment to see how my lesson went. It is often a quick three-question survey, but I do like having students write out a minute-paper to explain what they do and do not understand.

My assessments of student learning are often in the form of a cumulative project that applies the ideas we’ve learned throughout the semester. Throughout the course, we check in on the status of the final project by creating deliverables. This has worked especially well in the senior-level product design class that I teach. In this course, I have framed the semester project as a pitch for a design consulting firm. I play the role of the client, who vaguely provides some design constraints (last year it was to design a sit-to-stand desk adaptor), and then throughout the semester the students conduct market research and reframe the design to adapt to my latent needs. By the end of the semester, each team presents their business pitch and final unique design! The student teams often go way above the minimum requirements, because they like the competitive aspect of the final project.
