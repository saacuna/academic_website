Here are some things I've found helpful during my career.

## Books on Writing
> Like many engineering students, I didn't spend much time learning how to write. Engineering classes mostly required memos with lots of bullet points. In graduate school, I taught myself a lot about the writing process, and I found these books really helped me start to really enjoy writing.

- On Writing Well, William Zinsser
- Writing Science, Joshua Schimel
- How to write a lot, Paul Silvia.
- Essentials of Writing Biomedical Research Papers, Mimi Zeiger

## Concerning statistics
> Like writing, I didn't spend a lot of time as an undergraduate really learning the principles of statistics. Sure, I could do _t_-tests, but I didn't really understand what the stats were telling me, and I certainly couldn't understand most of the stats I was reading in journal articles. In graduate school, I took time to dive deeper into statistics, and here are some of my thoughts.

- I highly recommend taking a graduate statistics class, even if it is not required for your program.
- [Laerd statistics](http://statistics.laerd.com) is a practical online guide through the statistics process. It was developed for grad students who needed to run stats for their dissertations, but hadn't really received the proper training. Worth every penny.
- Don't get too caught up into only one stats package (R, SPSS, JMP, Statistica, etc). Learn the principles that you know you should be doing, and then use the right tool for the job. Odds are you will have to switch between them.
- Understand statistical power and how to calculate it. It helps justify your studies and validate your analyses. I recommend using [G\*Power](http://www.gpower.hhu.de/en.html).


## Software I Use
> My software preferences will change, because I like trying out new apps to be more productive. These are some of the ones I recommend, in addition to normal apps we use (Office products, MatLab, etc). A lot of these are for Mac only, though.

- Everything should be backed up using some cloud service, like [Box](http://www.box.com) or [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com).
- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) is my go to launcher for apps, documents, etc. Take the time to learn it, it is super convenient and makes life easier.
- [HazeOver](https://hazeover.com) is a super simple app that dims out other windows on your monitor. It helps me focus on the windows I want, because I usually have a ton of windows on my dual screen setup.
- Some sort of **text expander** will save a lot of time, especially in coding or writing the same thing over again (big jargon words, emails, etc). I use [TypeIt4Me](https://www.ettoresoftware.com/mac-apps/typeit4me/)---it is really cheap and super powerful.
- [Scapple](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scapple/overview) for freeform mind-mapping when writing papers. It helps me to lay everything out non-linearly to see the overall picture of the research story and how it all fits together.
- [Scrivener](http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview) for drafting papers, although including references are tricky. Keep in mind this software should really be used just for the drafting stage---once you start sharing documents with co-authors, MS Word is much easier to finish it up. But for starting out a paper and organizing all your wild ideas into a coherent story, this is great.
- [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com) for managing my references, as well as reading and annotating my PDFs. The plug-in for MS Word makes it easy to add citations and bibliographies. It amazes me how many people don't use a citation manager. If you don't, get one now, it will save a lot of time in the future.
- [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com) for software version-ing on [GitHub](http://www.github.com). You should really take the time to learn Git and GitHub, it will save you a ton of time and headache. I really like the GUI displaying all my branches, and lets me easily compare past versions of my coding.
- [Evernote](http://www.evernote.com) for managing little snippets of info related to work (passwords, licenses, important memos, notes from trainings, etc).
- [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/) or Adobe Illustrator to create figures for papers and posters for academic conferences.
- [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) for personal task management.
