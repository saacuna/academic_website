Hello! My name is Samuel Acuña. I am a biomechanical engineer finishing my PhD in Mechanical Engineering at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](http://www.wisc.edu). I work in the [Neuromuscular Biomechanics Lab](http://uwnmbl.engr.wisc.edu) with [Prof. Darryl Thelen](https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/me/Faculty/Thelen_Darryl/).

Research Interests:
- Neuromuscular Biomechanics
- Rehabilitation Engineering
- Motor Control
- Movement disorder, esp. altered gait
- Non-invasive neuromodulation
- Biomechanics of Aging 
- Biofeedback to improve gait

## Current Research Projects
- Muscle synergies and neuromuscular coordination after mild to moderate traumatic brain injury
- Cranial nerve non-invasive neuromodulation to alter muscle coordination of gait during rehabilitation for mild to moderate traumatic brain injury
- Subsensory Achilles tendon vibration for reducing sensitivity optic flow perturbations
- Visuomotor entrainment of postural control muscles during treadmill walking
- Effects of aging on antagonist leg muscle coactivation when walking with either optical flow perturbations or a cognitive dual-task
