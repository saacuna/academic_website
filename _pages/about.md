Hello! I am a biomechanical engineer interested in rehabilitation engineering and human-centered product design. I develop new technologies to address movement disorders that develop after injury, such as stroke or traumatic brain injury. I'm particularly interested in solving engineering problems for the hospital & health care industry with innovative and emerging technology, such as virtual reality and noninvasive neural stimulation. 

## Current Research Projects
- Non-invasive spinal stimulation to improve gait post-stroke
- The role of estrogen on Reciprocal Inhibition of the Soleus muscle
- Form and function of spinal circuitry related to muscle spindles using hybrid electrophysiologic and functional MRI
- Muscle synergies and neuromuscular coordination after mild to moderate traumatic brain injury
- Cranial nerve non-invasive neuromodulation to alter muscle coordination of gait during rehabilitation for mild to moderate traumatic brain injury

## Current Positions
- Postdoctoral Researcher, [Dept. of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation](https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/education/medical-school/departments/physical-medicine/)
    - [University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center](https://www.utsouthwestern.edu)
    - PI: [Dr. Yasin Dharer](https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/education/graduate-school/programs/biomedical-engineering/program-faculty.html)
- Technical Manager, [UTDesign Capstone Program](https://utdesign.utdallas.edu)
    - [University of Texas at Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu)
