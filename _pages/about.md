Hello! My name is Samuel Acuña. I am a biomechanical engineer in the department of [Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation](https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/education/medical-school/departments/physical-medicine/) at [UT Southwestern Medical Center](https://www.utsouthwestern.edu). I am postdoctoral researcher working with [Dr. Yasin Dharer](https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/education/graduate-school/programs/biomedical-engineering/program-faculty.html).

Research Interests:
- Neuromuscular Biomechanics
- Rehabilitation Engineering
- Motor Control
- Movement disorder, esp. altered gait
- Non-invasive neuromodulation
- Biomechanics of Aging
- Biofeedback to improve gait

## Current Research Projects
- Non-invasive spinal stimulation to improve gait post-stroke
- Muscle synergies and neuromuscular coordination after mild to moderate traumatic brain injury
- Cranial nerve non-invasive neuromodulation to alter muscle coordination of gait during rehabilitation for mild to moderate traumatic brain injury
